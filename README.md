Using manufacturing data obtained from Kaggle, this study compares four regression methods to evaluate the relationship between Temperature and Quality rating in a manufacturing dataset. This data comes from manufacturing processes worldwide. The results indicate that polynomial regression and truncated spline regression have high accuracy levels (99% R-squared), demonstrating that these models better predict data variability. Kernel regression follows with an R-squared of 89%. Linear regression, on the other hand, has a lower accuracy level (21% R-squared), indicating that explaining variability is rather difficult. Consequently, the analysis of this relationship is better suited to non-linear models.
